        <h1 class="Project1">1 - Milk Adulteration Monitoring System</h1>
        <p>
          Due to the wide consumption of milk, certain adulterations are added
          to increase its yield which causes serious health problems, this
          project focuses in the employment of an efficient, low-cost and
          portable system that monitors milk parameters using various sensors
          and detects adulterations by comparing it to FSSAI standards.
        </p>
        <h1 class="Project1">2 - Solar Energy Monitoring and Tracing</h1>
        <p>
          The system monitors and visualizes the voltage at the solar panel to
          the user, as well as adjusting itself to the direction of
          high-intensity sun radiation. The history of recorded voltages over
          time is also uploaded to the cloud and can be accessed if needed.
        </p>
        <h1 class="Project1">3 - Smart Vehicle Parking System</h1>
        <p>
          Simple project that intimates the free parking slots and occupied
          slots to the user by detection using sensor.
